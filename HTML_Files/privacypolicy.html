    <h1>My Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome! Your privacy is really important to me, and I want to be transparent about how your personal information is handled. This page explains how I collect, use, and share data when you visit my website, in line with UK laws like the GDPR.</p>
    
    <h2>What Information Do I Collect?</h2>
    <p>I don’t collect any personal data from you directly. However, some third-party services I use, like analytics tools, may collect anonymous data when you visit my site. This helps me improve the website and understand how people are using it.</p>
    
    <h2>What Data Gets Collected?</h2>
    <p>Here’s what third-party services might collect when you visit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your IP address:</strong> This helps me know where you're browsing from.</li>
        <li><strong>Your browser type:</strong> The type of browser you’re using to visit the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Pages visited:</strong> The specific pages you view on the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Time of visit:</strong> The date and time you come to the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Duration of visit:</strong> How long you stay on each page.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why Do I Collect This Data?</h2>
    <p>The data helps me with a few things, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Making the site work better for you.</li>
        <li>Understanding what users like and how they interact with the site.</li>
        <li>Measuring how well ads are performing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>I use services like Google Analytics to better understand how people are using the site. These third-party services may have their own privacy policies, so I encourage you to read them to learn more about how your data is handled.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since I don’t collect any personal data directly, there’s not much you need to worry about here. But if you're concerned about how third-party services use your data, I recommend reviewing their privacy policies. If you think your data’s been mishandled, you have the right to file a complaint with the relevant authorities.</p>
    
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>This site uses cookies to help improve your experience. If you want more details about cookies, check out my <a href="/HTML_Files/cookies.html">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>My site may include links to other websites, but I can’t control how they handle your data. So if you visit another site, it’s always a good idea to check their privacy policy before sharing any personal info.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>I take reasonable steps to protect the data collected by third-party services. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure, so please keep that in mind.</p>
    
    <h2>For Kids</h2>
    <p>This site isn’t intended for children under 13, and I don’t knowingly collect any data from them. If you're a parent or guardian and you think your child has shared personal information with me, feel free to get in touch.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this policy from time to time. If I do, I’ll post the updated version here with a new date. I’d recommend checking back periodically for any changes.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Me</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, don’t hesitate to get in touch:</p>
